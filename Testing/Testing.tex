\section*{Basic multi-cast with Unordered message ordering\\(Static : member count = 3)}

\begin{itemize}\itemsep 5pt \parskip 2pt \parsep 2pt
\item Member A joins (appointed as the leader)
\item Member B joins
\item Member C joins
\item Member B calls an election (Explicit)
\item Leader (e.g. C) leaves permanently (Automatic election)
\item Member multicast “Hello I am Member X” - can’t do it
\item Member call an election (explicit) - can’t do it
\item Member D joins
\item Member A multicasts “Hello I am Member A”
\item Member B multicasts “Hello I am Member B”.
\item Member D multicasts “Hello I am Member D”
\item Automatically release own messages
\item Member A releases the messages (regardless of the order)
\item Member B releases the messages (regardless of the order)
\item Member D releases the messages (regardless of the order)
\item Remove Group
